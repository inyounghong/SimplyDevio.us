<p><span class="l">We’re both rapping hong hong hong, are you watching? Are you listening? </span><span class="a">Hyngdon has used this expression for provoking GD. He has very bad fassion sense but probably in korea the only one who dare to criticize GD regarding fasion. That is the point of the joke.<img src="11.jpg"></span></p>
<br>
<p><span class="l">When he switches from 2G to LTE, he’s trying, trying to do something with you </span><span class="a"><img src="13.jpg"> <img srd="14.jpg"></span></p>

<p><span class="l">When he can’t normally drink but offers to be a black knight for you, he’s trying, trying to do something, trying desperately.</span><span class="a">At a party with alcohol, Koreans tend to encourage or force to drink making turns. To save a turn for usually a girl, a guy volunteers to drink for her. He is called a black knight. <img scr="16.jpg"></span></p>
<br>
<p><span class="l">Koongs koongs koongs, koong koong ddari koong koong dda, he’s trying, trying, trying to do something</span><span class="a"></span></p>
<p><span class="l">When he used to have a pus pillow but switches to latex, he’s trying, trying, trying to do something</span><span class="a">Pus pillow refers very dirty pillow which turns yellow. One of the musicans in Infinite Challenge music festival 2013 had an embarrassing moment when someone revealed his pus pillow. <img src="17.jpg"></span></p>
<p><span class="l">He has been fine but suddenly looks you with the eye of falcon</span><span class="a">If a guy’s  eyes change into like this….<img src="18.jpg"></span></p>
<p><span class="l">You know he’s trying to look at the sun? No, look at the moon. Trying  Trying.</span><span class="a"> Trying sounds in Korean, Hae-bol-la-go.  The first syllable hae sounds same with sun in Korean. They are playing with words.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span class="l">Fashion is completed with the face, hong hong hong </span><span class="a"> GD gave a lesson to Jung, hyungdon who had been criticized about his fashion in funny was. His message was that Hyungdon had been trying to improve his fashion but he is too ugly to compete with GD.<img src="19.jpg"></span></p>
<p><span class="l">How music is complete? Hyung-Yong-Don-Jong (Hyung Give Me Allowance) </span><span class="a"> Hyung from Hyung-don’s name <br>Meaning senior guy.  Yong from Ji-yong (GD’s real first name)  Don is from Hyung-don’s name. Yongdon means allowance. Jong  is blending sound of Ji-yong meaning give me in childish way.</span></p>
<p><span class="l">One plus one, Yong plus Don, when I say hip, you say hop, hip-hop</span><span class="a"></span></p>
<p><span class="l">On Saturday everyone watchs Infinity Challenge laughing ho ho ho </span><span class="a"> Infinity Challenge is a Korean variety show. <img src="20.jpg"></span></p>
<p><span class="l">Everyone sing along, trying to do something</span><span class="a"></span></p>
<p><span class="l">One plus one, Yong plus Don, let’s become one, say hip-hop (Wait a minute)</span><span class="a"></span></p>
