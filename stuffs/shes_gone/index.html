<h1>Chorus 1</h1>
<p><span class="l">Oh, she`s gone, yeah</span><span class="a"></span></p>
<p><span class="l">Oh, she`s gone, yeah</span><span class="a"></span></p>
<p><span class="l">Oh, she`s gone, yeah</span><span class="a"></span></p>
<p><span class="l">I love you, girl </span><span class="a"></span></p>
<p><span class="l">I love you, girl</span><span class="a"></span></p>

<p><span class="l">I’m drunken tonight, why’s the alcohol so sweet tonight?</span><span class="a"></span></p>
<p><span class="l">Is it because my eyes are aching after you left?</span><span class="a">This does not mean that he has an eye disease. This refers the split moment of sourness on the eyes right before tear swells. </span></p>
<p><span class="l">Loneliness that you can’t see the end hammers me</span><span class="a"></span></p>
<p><span class="l">Like a lost child, fucking the damn shit </span><span class="a"></span></p>

<p><span class="l">Excusing drunkenness , I call you like a habit</span><span class="a">Guys tend to call their ex-girl friends when they get drunken, which mostly not be welcomed. <br> “ I will you call everyday.” From Infinite Challenge, a Korean variety show.</span></p>
<p><span class="l">You voice still makes me flutter</span><span class="a">This is the clear sign of lingering  attachment. </span></p>
<p><span class="l">Can not clearly remember our talk but getting intense</span><span class="a">We exchange some harsh words</span></p>
<p><span class="l">I don’t say anymore,  only long silence</span><span class="a"></span></p>

<h1>Chorus 2</h1>
<p><span class="l">I think I’m pathetic, I think I’m  obsessive</span><span class="a"><img src="8.jpg"></span></p>
<p><span class="l">My case is serious, whenever I see you, I get obsessive</span><span class="a"></span></p>
<p><span class="l">Call me crazy, didn’t you know that I’m fierce?</span><span class="a"></span></p>
<p><span class="l">More pathetic thing is  that all my guilt was nothing but loving you</span><span class="a"></span></p>

<p><span class="l">Oh, you gotta go, you should go find your perfect love</span><span class="a"></span></p>
<p><span class="l">I tore up all the smiles you showed me</span><span class="a"></span></p>
<p><span class="l">I ground up your love in my heart</span><span class="a"></span></p>
<p><span class="l">Give that bastard this message for me, ‘Watch your back’</span><span class="a">"Bastard" refers the new boyfriend. <br> This is the epitome of grudge and pathetic mind.</span></p>

    <p><span class="h">Chorus 1 (x2)</span><span class="c">
        Oh, she`s gone, yeah<br>
        Oh, she`s gone, yeah<br>
        Oh, she`s gone, yeah<br>
        I love you, girl <br>
        I love you, girl<br>
    </span></p>

<p><span class="l">I linger around you as a friend</span><span class="a">Once rejected but he still wants to stay around her. What else he can do except being a friend?</span></p>
<p><span class="l">I look foolish even in my own eyes</span><span class="a"></span></p>
<p><span class="l">To grab or let go, I push and pull on this lingering attachment, oh, what do I do?</span><span class="a"></span></p>
<p><span class="l">I did everything you asked of me, but what now?</span><span class="a"></span></p>
<p><span class="l">You’re bored of me?</span><span class="a"></span></p>
<p><span class="l">You said I was the only one, was it just something you spat in the moment?</span><span class="a"></span></p>

    <p><span class="h">Chorus 2</span><span class="c">
        I think I’m pathetic, I think I’m  obsessive<br>
        My case is serious, whenever I see you, I get obsessive<br>
        Call me crazy, didn’t you know that I’m fierce?<br>
        More pathetic thing is  that all my guilt was nothing but loving you<br>
    </span></p>

<p><span class="l">Oh, you gotta go, follow the love you desire</span><span class="a"></span></p>
<p><span class="l">I’m just a rest stop you took a break at</span><span class="a"></span></p>
<p><span class="l">Out of all  that passed you by</span><span class="a"></span></p>
<p><span class="l">I was just a peanut  avoiding boredom, it enraged me</span><span class="a">People eat snacks (peanut) sometimes just because  they have nothing else to do. <img scr="nut.jpg"></span></p>
<p><span class="l">Now You’re saying sorry? Even a passing dog will laugh</span><span class="a">A girl would say, I am sorry. I cannot think of you more than a good friend. I found another guy. This is G- Dragon’s reaction to that. <br> A passing person on street could be absolutely objective on our issue because he/she is not related with any part of us. A passing dog which has lower IQ and more detached will say that you are unfair.</span></p>

    <p><span class="h">Chorus 1 (x2)</span><span class="c">
        Oh, she`s gone, yeah<br>
        Oh, she`s gone, yeah<br>
        Oh, she`s gone, yeah<br>
        I love you, girl <br>
        I love you, girl<br>
    </span></p>

<p><span class="l">Okay, fine, I won’t bother you anymore<br>
I’ll just think that you no longer exist<br>
If you are happy, then I am happy too, so,you can go to him</span><span class="a">G-Dragon changes his mood to compromise.Now he is so desperate begging for one last meeting. He is even lying. In reality he is not fine about the break up and he wants to keep her.</span></p>
<p><span class="l">Please meet me just one last time</span><span class="a"></span></p>
<p><span class="l">I’m sorry, baby, should’t you give me a chance to apologize?</span><span class="a">He is trying to apologize for being too upset.</span></p>
<p><span class="l">I’m human too , don’t you think I feel guilty?</span><span class="a">Oh, he did something enough to feel guilty. Maybe he expressed his rage, yelling or crying. GD gives us room to imagine about the drama.</span></p>
<p><span class="l">Your memory is disappearing, you look far off</span><span class="a"></span></p>
<p><span class="l">I can’t stand this feeling</span><span class="a"></span></p>

<p><span class="l">Let’s go somewhere there is no one<br>
because I want to be alone with you</span><span class="a">Visualize a guy who looks around with nervousness and says this. Girls! Be careful!</span></p>

<p><span class="l">Now you’re not going anywhere</span><span class="a"></span></p>

    <p><span class="h">Chorus 1 (x2)</span><span class="c">
        Oh, she`s gone, yeah<br>
        Oh, she`s gone, yeah<br>
        Oh, she`s gone, yeah<br>
        I love you, girl <br>
        I love you, girl<br>
    </span></p>

<p><span class="l">There’s strange news going around</span><span class="a"></span></p>
<p><span class="l">A man went all around the neighborhood in search of a girl</span><span class="a"><img src="9.jpg"></span></p>

<p><span class="l">There’s strange news going around</span><span class="a"></span></p>
<p><span class="l">A woman disappeared a few nights ago</span><span class="a"><img src="10.jpg"></span></p>
<p><span class="l">She vanished with a scream</span><span class="a"></span></p>

<p><span class="l">Yeah, I love you, girl</span><span class="a"></span></p>

    <p><span class="h">Chorus 1 (x2)</span><span class="c">
        Oh, she`s gone, yeah<br>
        Oh, she`s gone, yeah<br>
        Oh, she`s gone, yeah<br>
        I love you, girl <br>
        I love you, girl<br>
