          <strong>Q: Will Fiberspark Internet be available at my apartment?</strong><br/>
          A: It depends on your landlord. Fiberspark is talking to as many Collegetown landlords as possible to get them on board. We need their approval to include their apartments in our Collegetown-wide network buildout.

          <strong>Q: What can I do to bring Fiberspark to my apartment?</strong><br/>
          A: We are working with landlords right now to bring Fiberspark to as many Collegetown apartments as possible. To prove to them the demand for better Internet and get them signed on, we have formalized the process to present your demand to your landlord using our <a href="https://fiberspark.typeform.com/to/Wh6HOD">pre-written request form</a>.
          </p>

          <p class="txt">
          <strong>Q: When will I be able to get it?</strong><br/>
          A: Some Collegetown apartments already have Fiberspark Internet. We will be expanding our network in two phases, this summer and next spring. All targeted buildings in Collegetown will be connected by no later than 2015.

          <strong>Q: Why isn't Fiberspark an option at my apartment?</strong><br/>
          A: This means that either we don't know about your landlord because they only own a few properties, or because they haven't agreed to be part of our network buildout. In either case, use our <a href="https://fiberspark.typeform.com/to/Wh6HOD">pre-written request form</a> to help get them on board.
