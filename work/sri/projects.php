The present initative was built upon a workshop cosponsored by SRI-Rice in 2011: The First International Workshop on the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) in Latin America and the Caribbean, which was held at EARTH University in Costa Rica on October 31 - November 1, 2011, brought together groups interested in SRI to discuss how to move forward with evalutating and extending SRI in Latin America. </p>

                            <p>Through the Haiti Initiative, SRI-Rice has been providing technical back-stopping for SRI projects in Haiti since 2010. During June 2013, an SRI Training of Trainers program in the Coronel-Dubre region took place in collaboration with the iF Foundation and the Better U iF and BUF SRI training 2013Foundation (BUF). SRI-Rice subsequently began working with iF Foundation on a pilot project near Milot in Northern Haiti. During 2013 and 2014, SRI-Rice intern Zhoucen Feng helped set up SRI comparison and varietal trials, train technicians to monitor and evaluate yield data using scientific methods, and test several cell phone-based data collection models. </p>

                            <p>The research project "Reducing Inorganic Arsenic Levels in Rice by Appropriate Water Management" was among twelve successful proposals selected by the David R. Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future to receive funding from the 2014 Academic Venture Fund. The System of Rice Intensification, which recommends moist rather than flooded fields, is one of the water management regimes that will be investigated in regards to its potential to reduce arsenic content in rice. </p>

                            <p>One of the bottlenecks to adoption of SRI in many areas is access to equipment, primarily that needed to carry out planting and weeding operations. This is especially important where labor is expensive or unavailable, or where farmers are already used to mechanized equipment. As SRI methods require changes in some of the conventional rice production practices, equipment must be adapted or invented in order work effectively.</p>
