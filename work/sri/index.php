				<h1>The Solution</h1> 

				<p>Fortunately there’s an alternative. The System of Rice Intensification, or SRI, lets farmers increase yields while reducing or eliminating agrochemical use, increasing plant and soil health, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and cutting water use up to 50%. SRI is simply a different and unexpected way of managing rice field differently, and can be used with any variety of rice. For over 10 million farmers in 50+ countries, SRI is already helping them change how rice is grown. <a href="aboutsri.php">Learn More</a></p>

				<blockquote>"In rice, they're using a system called the System of Rice Intensification, which allows them to use less water, less fertilizer, more safe inputs. And they're seeing a big increase, doubling or tripling of yields, and a 75 percent increase in farm incomes because of that program, which has now reached almost 10,000 farm households, and we believe will reach 125,000 over time."</blockquote>

				<blockquote>"On Thursday, September 15, I had the opportunity to meet Emyl Mil, a rice farmer in Haiti…he was excited about the use of a new, innovative approach called System of Rice Intensification. This new technique has significantly increased rice yields using fewer seeds and less water and fertilizer. Mr. Mil has even shared the technique with fellow farmers, who are seeing the same results."</blockquote>
