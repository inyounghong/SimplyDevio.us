    		<h4>About Us</h4>
            <h3>The SRI International Network and Resources Center</h3>
            <br>

            <p class="med">The SRI International Network and Resources Center (SRI-Rice) was established at Cornell University in 2010 in response to the increasing importance of the System of Rice Intensification (SRI), a climate-smart, yield-increasing methodology that is being utilized by more than 10 million smallholder farmers in over 55 countries (see map). SRI-Rice is housed at International Programs of Cornell's College of Agriculture and Life Sciences.</p>

            <p class="med">The use of the SRI methodology and its local adaptation to various rice systems, as well as other crops (Systerm of Crop Intensification, or SCI), is quickly spreading among resource-limited farmers in Asia, Africa and Latin America, improving yields, food security, farm-level income, while protecting the environment.</p>

            <p class="med">The widespread success at the farmers' level presents a great opportunity - and also challenge - to collect the knowledge and to make it available to other farmers, program developers, researchers and policy makers. SRI-Rice has set out on this path, striving to reach as many smallholder farmers as possible, enhancing the networking, promoting collaborative synergies and accelerating learning.</p>

                    <p class="l">SRI-Rice collects, organizes, stores and shares SRI knowledge resources received from partners around the world and from daily Internet searches. We share SRI knowledge via SRI-Rice Online, which is comprised of the SRI-Rice website, various social media, our newsletter, and research databases, as well as associated video, photo and presentation channels and web services. </p>

                    <h3>Knowledge Generation <br>and Research</h3>
                    <p class="l">We advance knowledge through our own analysis and research, and we advise partners either on their research activities or technical implementation with farmer-based field programs. We participate in scientific projects, such as a multi-country arsenic research study currently underway. </p>

                    <p class="l">With many years of direct experience working with farmers on technical innovations, the SRI-Rice team is active in providing technical advice and backstopping to field programs in several countries. The advice ranges from farmer-centered implementation approaches to agronomic techniques and practices. </p>

                    <p class="l">An informal international SRI network has been developing since 2000. Since then, SRI has been recognized, supported and utilized by a growing number of NGOs, universities, farmer groups, government and research institutions, the private sector, and donor agencies. </p>
