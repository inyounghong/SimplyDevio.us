    <h2>How do I get the source URL of an image online?</h2>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>Right click on an image and select the option that is most similar to "Copy Image URL".

        <img src="{{root}}/images/get_image_url.png">

        <p>The image URL is now on your clipboard, and you can select <b>paste</b> or press <b>CTRL + V</b> to use your image URL. Note that the image URL is <i>not</i> the URL of the page you found your image on.</p>

    <h2>How do I get the source URL of an image that isn't online?</h2>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>To get the source URL of an image that isn't online, such as one on your computer, you must first upload the image onto any image hosting website. For example, you can use DevianART's <a href="http://sta.sh/">Sta.sh</a>. Upload your image, and then follow the steps explained in the previous answer above.</p>
