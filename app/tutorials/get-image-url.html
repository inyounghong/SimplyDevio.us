    <p>Any image that you want to use for deviantART skins must first be uploaded on a website.
    If you want to use an image of your own, you can first upload your image onto an image hosting site such as dA's <a href="http://sta.sh/">Sta.sh</a></p>

    <p>The image URL is NOT the URL of the page you found your image on. To find the image URL, you must
    right click on an image and select the option that is most similar to "Copy Image URL".

    <img src="{{root}}/images/get_image_url.png">

    <p>The image URL is now on your clipboard, and you can select paste or press CTRL + V to use your image URL. </p>

    <code><<i></i>img src="IMAGE URL"></code>
