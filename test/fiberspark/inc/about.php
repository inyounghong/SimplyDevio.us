      <p>Fiberspark's mission is to provide a better alternative than the cable monopoly for Internet service. We strive to provide connectivity that doesn't slow down or cut out. Our top priority is a reliable Internet connection that you can always depend on. If a customer has an issue of any kind, we guarantee immediate assistance from someone right here in Ithaca who can resolve the problem.</p>
      <p>Fiberspark means fast downloads and uploads which enables all sorts of useful applications like HD video streaming and cloud storage. We believe that it should be just as easy to create on the Internet as it is to consume. This is made possible by our use of fiber optics, the best technology available for delivering Internet access.</p>
